# Change Log

## Updated version 

Demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook efficiency_demo.ipynb.

Improvements made:

* The main parts of the code added to functions and in python modules.
* These can be imported as is and applied to different datasets.
* These can also be incorporated in other python software.
* Also, testing can be applied to ensure the correct code behaviour.
* Automatic reading of the experimental and simulation data from a specified directory.
* Automatic pick up of the correct data (temperature) from the csv files.
* Automatic pick up of the efficiency values from the file names.
* Allow the user to choose a set of the thermocouple data to be included in the analysis or all vs. specified only specific data before.


## Initial version 

All code is in 2 Jupyter notebooks:

efficiency.ipynb & heat_source_parameters.ipynb
